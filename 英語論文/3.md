3. Verification of Business Agility Improvements by Applying a Serverless Architecture

 In this chapter, we built a website for purchasing goods using a serverless architecture, and compare it with the construction work in an on-premises environment, and describe the result of verifying whether the development period will be reduced.
 
 The scope of verification is the part of system development that is developed by the IT department using a serverless architecture based on the business strategy determined by the management.  
 
 The reducing of the development period is verified from the following two points of view.  
　・Amount of documentation  
　・System construction work time  

3.1 Temporary and Premises  
　Hypotheses and assumptions in the verification process are described.
